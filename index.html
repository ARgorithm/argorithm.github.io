          <h2>Improving the Standards of Software Engineering Education</h2>
          <p>
            Augmented reality is the future of visual aids and is slowly but surely creeping its way into 
            the education industry, most notably in the medical education sector.
            ARgorithm hopes to introduce augmented reality to software engineering courses by giving easy 
            tools to create, broadcast and view augmented reality visualisations.

          <h3>Dynamic Visualisations Designed to Educate</h3>
          <p>Augmented reality visualisations made using ARgorithm are dynamic in nature. Once you submit your code, the visualisations
            are generated in real time based on user input. Hence, you can visualise how the same code reacts to different inputs. Additionally, the
            ARgorithm comment system allows you to explain your algorithms step by step along with the visualisation.
          </p>

        <div class="blueprint-item col-11_xs-10">
          <h3>Flexible Use</h3>
          <p>Your ARgorithm Server deployment can be highly customised. You can run it on your local machine, you can run it as a docker image on a cluster and
            you can customise features such as authentication, database and storage upto your liking. 
            The server repository contains kubernetes and docker-compose configuration files for different types of deployments.

        <div class="blueprint-item col-11_xs-10">
          <h3>Focus on your Algorithms</h3>
          <p>ARgorithmToolkit provides an abstract interface to create your visualisations in a manner which is quite similar to the STL in C++
            so that you can focus on implementing your algorithm. ARgorithmToolkit comes with a CLI which provides an easy to use interface
            to setup your environment and interact with the server.

          <p>We at ARgorithm make sure that every release is well documented with API level documentation as well as tutorials explaining
            everything from the working of ARgorithm to how you can use ARgorithm for your own unique use case.
